# MechanismTestBoard
This is code to run 3 motor controllers from a separate board with potentiometers and LEDs, and then 
there's some other fancy stuff in the wiring diagram like relays for a "sync" mode and switches that flip solenoids. 
This is for testing any variety of mechanisms so Andy will stop stealing my test board

"SpeedController.ino" only controlls one motor controller and I'm *pretty* sure it's the version that worked


Once I either find or recreate from memory the wiring diagram it will go here
